# spoke-hub-integration
A Hub-and-Spoke integration model of Software Engineering Tools

This plugin integrates Jenkins with [Slack] (https://slack.com/).
It allows to receive [Slash Commands] (https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) from Slack via
HTTP POST requests and trigger the corresponding actions.

The plugin currently supports the following commands:

	1. /jenkins build JOB [-p]
	
	   Starts a build for any type of job.
	   
	   JOB : Name of the job to build
	   -p  : Specifies the build parameters in the key=value format
	   
	   Examples:
	   
	   - /jenkins build MyJob
	   - /jenkins build MyJob -p key1=value1 ... -p keyN=valueN
	   
	2. /jenkins test JOB SCOPE [CLASS]
	
	   Performs tests for a maven job.
	   
	   JOB   : Name of the maven job to test
	   SCOPE : Specifies the scope of the test. You can choose between:
	           all : tests all classes
	           class : tests specific classes
	   CLASS : List of classes separated by a comma. (E.g. Test1,Test2,...)
	   
	   Examples:
	   
	   - /jenkins test MyJob all
	   - /jenkins test MyJob class Test1,Test2,...
	   
	3. /jenkins list-jobs
	
	   Lists all jobs.
	   
	4. /jenkins help [COMMAND]
	
	   Lists all the available commands or a detailed description of single command.
	   
	   COMMAND : Name of the command
	   
	   Examples:
	   
	   - /jenkins help
	   - /jenkins help build
	   
	NOTE: project names and parameters must comply with the following restrictions:
	      - they must not contain spaces
	      - they can start with a lowercase letter, capital letter, underscore or $
	
	NOTE: if you make a class test and there are classes with the same name but are in different packages, 
	      the test command will test all these classes
